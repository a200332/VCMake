<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>List::MoreUtils::Contributing - Gives rough introduction into contributing to List::MoreUtils</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>List::Moreutils has a turbulent history and a strong approach. Before going further, please step to <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html">Open Source Contribution Etiquette</a> and then come back.</p>

<p>The current distribution is a balance between finishing the history and claiming for future requirements. Therefore some components will receive a rewrite on purpose - others won&#39;t.</p>

<p>For the moment - it&#39;s not the primary goal to clean up the configuration stage, until the primary goals and prerequisites are done.</p>

<p>To contribute to List::MoreUtils, one has to arrange with the current situation, dig into details and ask for clarifying when parts are incomprehensible.</p>

<h2 id="Primary-Goals">Primary Goals</h2>

<p>The very first primary goal is to clear the backlog. These are primarily the open issues, feature requests and missing infrastructure elements.</p>

<p>As example see RT#93207 or RT#75672 for missing configure time checks, while RT#93207 radiates until test - but doesn&#39;t affect runtime nor installation (beside test failures).</p>

<h2 id="Secondary-Goals">Secondary Goals</h2>

<p>Secondary goals are harmonizing the function names and calling convention (see RT#102673), tidying the infrastructure of the distribution and remove unnecessary complexity (while protecting the necessary).</p>

<p>One example of removing unnecessary infrastructure could be to move <a>Data::Tumbler</a> and <a>Test::WriteVariants</a> into authoring mode, when improved test for RT#93207 could be reasonably done by a module which is recommended for test. The recommendation of <a href="https://github.com/haarg/List-MoreUtils/blob/dd877f963deead742fc90005636c72c6be9060fc/Makefile.PL#L82">Graham Knop&#39;s Makefile.PL#L82</a> in <a href="https://github.com/perl5-utils/List-MoreUtils/pull/9">PR#9</a> a desirable one.</p>

<h2 id="Orientation-Guide">Orientation Guide</h2>

<p>List::MoreUtils configuration stage heavily depends on <a>Config::AutoConf</a> and <a>Data::Tumbler</a>. A few prerequisites of both modules aren&#39;t available for Perl 5.6 - which leads to a tiny emulation layer t the begin of <code>Makefile.PL</code>.</p>

<p>The reason for <a>Config::AutoConf</a> is quite simple - the opportunities for checking the environment cover a much wider range than a simple test whether there is a working compiler. It requires a lot of improvements since its base <a href="../../../lib/ExtUtils/CBuilder.html">ExtUtils::CBuilder</a> was never designed to support that kind of solutions - but there is <i>Work In Progress</i>. To finally solve issues as RT#75672 even in cross-compile environments - there is no way around such a checking tool.</p>

<p>The reason for <a>Data::Tumbler</a> in combination with <a>Test::WriteVariants</a> are extensible tests with reasonable effort and easy figuring out which extra condition causes failures. Also - missing pre-conditions should result in failing tests i some cases - what is fully supported by the logic behind <a>Data::Tumbler</a> in combination with <a>Test::WriteVariants</a>.</p>

<p>Finally - <a>inc::latest</a> glues the stuff in a bundle together to allow people with older toolchains to use List::MoreUtils out of the box (maybe with reduced quantity but full quality).</p>
